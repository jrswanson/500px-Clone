# ShutterStop
ShutterStop is a photography sharing app that enables commmunity interactions between photographers. It was inspired by 500px. The backend uses Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, while the frontend uses React and Redux. I built the project over a ten day period and plan on adding more features in the future.
